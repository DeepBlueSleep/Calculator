# Calculator
A simple calculator app made using Python.

It makes use of commands to perform calculations:

* Addition

  `sum(val1, val2, ...)`

* Subtraction

  `sub(val1, val2)`

* Multiplication

  `mul(val1, val2, ...)`

* Division

  `div(val1, val2)`

* View all commands

  `help`

Notes
======
The program will filter out any non-numeric character (except for periods). This is to prevent the program from crashing when encountering foreign characters in its calculations.

To use it, simply enter a command and insert the values within the parentheses. Make sure to separate the values with a comma.

An example of a command would be:

`div(27.9, 3)`

which would output

`9.3`
